### About Me

Currently working as iOS Software Engineer at [Tokopedia](https://github.com/tokopedia). I always love and crave to learn new things, especially something sounds fun and challenging at a same time.

I do most of my code with Swift, and i believe Swift is the best language in the world.Currently exploring Swift for scripting, and backend stuff.

Very Greatful WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge Winner.
